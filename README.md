# HomeJungle

HomeJungle helps newbies or people with close to zero experience to get started with indoor plants. 

The user can search for seeds and seedlings from other users or a local community nearby. Additionally, he can plan which plants he wants to grow and the app reminds him when to start planting the seeds.

The app will provide the possibility to search for different plants and get information about them like how much water or sun the plant needs. The user can add the plants he/she owns in a personal area and get notified when he/she is supposed to water them.
